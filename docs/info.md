## How it works

Our ASIC can work as standalone device or can be integrated with a processor. the processor multiplexes the data 

## How to test

By utilizing the FPGA, we can simulate and verify the chip's functionality, ensuring it operates as intended. The SPI support allows us to establish communication between the FPGA and the VLSI chip, enabling data exchange that helps us assess the chip's performance under different scenarios. This approach allows us to identify and address potential issues in the VLSI design before moving to full-scale production, ensuring it meets all design specifications.
